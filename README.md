This exam requires you to create a Windows Forms Application.
 The exam is an open textbook, open lecture presentations (unaltered electronic versions downloaded from Canvas during the exam), and you may use the Microsoft Learn site (MSDN) through the F1 key in Visual Studio.
 However, you may not use code from lab assignments or class code examples, any other online resources, exchange files, send or receive code, help another person complete the exam, or receive help from anyone in any way other than me or the TA.
You need to create a program used by Temple University advisors to handle registering students for a course.
 The program should allow an advisor to enter the information for enrolling a student into a course (course number, student ID, student name, semester, year) and record it in the database.
 The semester should be either Fall, Spring, Summer 1, or Summer 2.
 Use a drop-down box or radio-group to allow the user to select one of these options for the semester. 
The program must also allow the advisor to find and display a student’s roster, which is simply a list of courses the student was previously enrolled in for a specific semester and year in the database.
 Finally, the program must allow the advisor to delete a course from the student’s roster when the student drops a class, which involves deleting the record in the database. 
You need to properly implement the application using Component-Based Software Design and the MVC design pattern by creating the necessary classes and properly utilizing them in the application.   
You must demonstrate the proper use of MVC and Component-Based Software Design. 
The classes you write should not rely on the form or the controls on it. The classes should be fully functional in any program that may need them. 
 This means you need to write each method to accept data it needs to perform a task and return any output that may be needed by the program that calls this method. 
Finally, you must manually write the code to work with and manipulate an Access database; you cannot use controls and wizards to simplify database operations.
